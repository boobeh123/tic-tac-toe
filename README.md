Boobeh123: 
It was exciting to watch our project go from pseudocode to a functional game. 
This project has taught me more about personal growth than technical knowledge.

Our timezones have a decent difference. It was a hurdle that required planning in advance.
There were multiple occasions where we had to stop to clarify a method or conditional. I learned I have to be assertive and ask questions.
Orobor0s displayed humility and kindness through example; not only did I understand after asking questions, it was not condenscending.
I would be thrilled to build with you if you'll allow!
